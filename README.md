# Doctor-Patient Appointment System

## Abstract

The objective of the project is to create an “Online Doctor-Patient Appointment System” web app as a part of my internship at “TechVariable Pvt Ltd.”.

The Doctor-Patient Appointment System is a digital platform designed to streamline and simplify the process of scheduling and managing appointments between doctors and patients. This system aims to enhance communication and convenience for doctors and patients, ultimately improving the healthcare experience. This project is an EHR project being developed at TechVariable.

The Doctor-Patient Appointment System allows patients to easily get register, create a profile and add their medical records. They can easily search for doctors based on their names specialty, location, and availability. They can see the details of the doctors. Once a suitable doctor is selected, patients can request an appointment at their preferred date and visiting location of the doctor. The patient can easily see the history of the appointment and their status.

Doctors, on the other hand, benefit from an organized and automated appointment system. They can update their profile and update their availability status. They are also allowed to add multiple visiting locations and visiting hours for those locations. Upon receiving the appointment, the doctor can confirm, or cancel it. After checking the patient on the day of the appointment doctor can mark the appointment as complete. Each update on the status of the appointment is sent to the respective patient through email. The doctor is provided with an easy-to-use interface and a short summary of current-day appointment statistics.

This system segregates the current-day appointments and arranges them in different segments making the work of doctors more convenient.

By implementing the Doctor-Patient Appointment System, healthcare institutions can optimize their appointment scheduling processes, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance patient satisfaction. Patients can access quality healthcare services easily, while doctors can efficiently manage their schedules and provide personalized care. Overall, this system aims to foster a seamless doctor-patient relationship and improve healthcare access for all.
